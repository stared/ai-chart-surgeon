# General rules

- It is a simple, one-page app (no touter!) that you upload a chart, get feedback from AI, and plot remaster in Plot library.
- Create clean, well-designed code that will make maintainters happy. Less code is better.
- Properly encapsulate things, with good, well-desgined interfaces.
- Use types consistently. Avoid any and optional types unless strictly necessary.
- Don't pass errors silently. If you have an assumption about code and it is brokes, there should be an error.
- Think twice before nesting conditional instructions, if there is no cleaner way.
- Don't repeat yourself - split code in clear, composable blocks.
- IMORTANT: If you have made a decision, explain why and first ask me if to follow. If I agree, proceed.
- Be default, install newest version of libraries.
- Use TypeScript according to best rules. 
- Type things properly, avoiding optional types (unless it is a conscious decision).
- Don't use "any" unless there is not other way around.
- Don't use folder-ups "../" in imports - specify path. NEVER EVER use in Vue files "../" under no circumstances. 
- We use yarn package manager.
- Installed things are in @package.json.

# Design

- Design is minimal yet playful, for nerds.
- Vibe close to tools like ChatGPT, Linear.app, MidJourney - focused yet playful.
